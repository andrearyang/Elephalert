# Elephant-Trap

Raspberry Pi Pico, PIR Motion Sensor, Buzzer, LED, Arduino Keypad

Our project uses five parts that centers around a Pico. When motion is detected, the buzzer and LED both turn on, playing an alarm sound as well as a red light. These can only be deactivated once the correct 4-digit code is typed into the keypad. Elephant Trap will alert a human of any zombie that dares to get near a safe space or important facility, all while being disguised as a cute, squeaky elephant.
